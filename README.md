- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vinicius, i'm a 17 year old who likes computer stuff!
- Brazillian
- Computer engineering enthusiast
- I'm currently doing an internship, at my townhall in the secretary of education

The languages i'm familiarized with are JAVA, Javascript, HTML and Css, and the Arduino varian of C++

I normally don't have a lot of projects because i've got a severe lack of creativity, and it's probably never gonna be anything usefull, sorry
